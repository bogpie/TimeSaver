TimeSaver is your companion when you want to be productive. It can help you organize a working session while managing breaks automatically. 
When you open the app, you will be prompted to select how much time you want for your working session. You then have to choose the number of breaks you want and the time for each break. TimeSaver then creates the cycles for work and breaks in an organized manner - each of your working cycles will last the same and the breaks will be placed uniformly in your session.
Here is a simple example:
- Session is set as 2 minutes, including work cycles and breaks
- You have set 1 break of 1 minute
- This means that the time left for work is 2 minutes - 1 minute = 1 minute
- As stated previously, work cycles are the number of breaks + 1. This is so that you always start with a work cycle and always end with one.
- This means that after you finish the 30-second countdown, you'll have another 1 minute of break, as you have set up, and then another 30-second countdown for work.
